A very simple utility based on an existing project that allows formatting any drive into the FAT32 file system.
This project was created as a lightweight and straightforward solution with minimal interface and functionality — just format a disk to FAT32 quickly and reliably.

It serves mainly as a simplified wrapper around the original tool, focusing on ease of use and basic functionality without unnecessary complexity.

⚠️ Use at your own risk. Formatting will erase all data on the selected drive.
